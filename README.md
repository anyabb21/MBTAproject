# Project Writeup and Reflection
# Project Overview - In this project, I was to build an app that helped user identify the closest MBTA station in the Boston area using python, html, flasking and more. The app includes basic form validation using WTForms, error handling, and dynamic page generation. Key features include an interactive map showing both the userâ€™s location and the nearest station, as well as an autocomplete input field for easier data entry. Beyond the core requirements, the app also features improved error messages, a loading spinner for better user experience, and a responsive design using Bootstrap. These additions enhance the overall usability and interactivity of the application.

# Reflection
# development process
# Since I was behind in a lot of the coursework, it definitely took me some time to understand how to do the project and it took me a while to figure everything out. Leveraging Chat GPT and Perplexity did help a lot, not only with speeding up the process but also with helping me understand the correct structure, how errors formed and how to solve them. However, if I weren't too tired and were up to date with the course work, my reliance on AI would have been much less. 
# This was a one man job for me so there was no team division.
# My biggest learnings from this project included learning how to scrap data from websites through their urls, through identifying a key and toke (specifically from the MBTA case) and learning how an html file and python file interact with each other.
